\begin{abstract}

  \textit{Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common injuries in sports. While significant research has been conducted for identifying the factors responsible, there is a need to quantitatively determine an athlete's risk of suffering the injury in real time. To this end, we explore the opportunity to mount a high performance, small area circuit on a knee wrap. We integrate a set of factors such as knee acceleration, knee orientation and valgus forces for computing the risk percentage of an athlete in real time. In addition, this knee wrap will also be multi-purpose, allowing both doctors to predict injuries and athletes prevent injuries on the field.

  \textit{The design incorporates microcontrollers, inertial measurement unit sensors and wireless module mounted on the knee wrap. In order for the therapists and physicians to interact with the data, we are using a server to display the data. We are able to show that the sensors measure accurate data at \FIXME(Hz) frequency, successfully transmit to the server and display the data.}

% practice to label every (sub)-section, graph, equation etc. -- this

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
ACL ruptures are one of the most common injuries in sport and very expensive to treat.There are approximately 175, 000 primary ACL reconstruction surgeries performed annually in the USA with an estimated cost of over \$2 billion US \cite{yu2007mechanisms}. This is followed by a lengthy rehabilitation period. Even then, over a quarter of patients reinjure their ACL \cite{stevenson1998gender}. An ACL injury can have an immense impact on an athelete's career and quality of life. Because of this, preventing ACL injuries is exceptionally valuable and important.

We propose the use of an electronic knee wrap (eKwip), to predict and prevent ACL injuries in both healthy athletes and injured patients. By monitoring the angles, orientation and movements of the knee of the wearer, eKwip is able to predict when an injury is imminent. We propose to create a prevention mechanism to cushion knee and prevent the knee from bending at angles that may cause an ACL rupture. This mechanism will be triggered in case of imminent danger. To encourage adoption of such a knee wrap, eKwip is designed to be unobtrusive and flexible, unlike the current mechanical braces on the market.

eKwip allows the wearer to monitor his or her knee performance and risk of injury throughout the day to decrease the chance of future injury. It also allows physical therapist to easily observe and assess the performance of injured patients remotely. With eKwip, the aim is to reduce the rate of ACL injuries in both healthy athletes and injured patients.

eKwip utilizes various factors that have been demonstrated to cause the injury such as accelerations and angles. It integrates these factors with machine learning algorithm to accurately calculate the risk by adapting to the athlete's physical characteristics such as flexiblity and normal range of knee movement. Currently, the microcontroller (Mbed) receive knee acceleration and orientation angles from the sensors. Using a wireless module, this data is quickly transmitted to the server, which calibrates the angles and acceleration, and displays them on the website in a user friendly format.

% however, LaTeX commands are minimal and 'normal text' is frequent.
