The project timeline is split into the following sections - already completed, prior to thanksgiving, prior to Christmas, completion and if time permits.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Already completed:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Ordering of materials required for first prototype
        \item Speak with experts in field to find out possible causes of ACL tear
        \item Speak with doctors to find out the benefit of such a product to the field
    \end{itemize*}
    \item Prior-to thanksgiving
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Prototype built
        \item Preliminary data collected
    \end{itemize*}
    \item Prior-to christmas
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Phase 1 completed
        \item Tweaking of sensors and measurements on prototype
        \item Allow data to be stored on microcontroller
        \item Capable of displaying data collected in a user friendly interface.
    \end{itemize*}
    \item Completion tasks
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Phase 2 completed
        \item Speak with experts in field to determine risk index
        \item Conduct more testing to improve accuracy of measurements
        \item Real time prediction of injury
        \item Streaming of data from wrap to server
        \end{itemize*}
    \item If there's time
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Phase 3 completed
        \item Research material needed for injury prevention mechanism
        \item Integrate material with eKwip
        \item Connect the prevention mechanism to the prediction algorithm
    \end{itemize*}
\end{enumerate}
