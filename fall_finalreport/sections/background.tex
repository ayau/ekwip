As the paper includes interdisciplinary content, we provide information in this section about the knee mechanics to assist the reader throughout the paper. The knee joint is the largest joint in the human body that connects the femur and tibia. ACL is one of the four major ligaments in the knee. It originates from deep within the lower extremity of the femur and attaches in front of the spine of tibia. The figure below is representative of the knee anatomy and the location of ACL. 
\FIXME(Add knee figure. Figure 3 from http://www.aclsolutions.com/anatomy.php. Edit figure to locate femur top and tibia bottom).

ACL is reponsible for resisting anterior translation and medial rotation of the tibia, in relation to the femur. This resistance is crucial for controlling the sideways movement of the knee and supporting the weight of the body. Most common reason for the ACL injury is due to unsymmetric distributed forces acting on the joint. These forces are caused due to sudden movements such as changing directions or landing from a jump, which are most common in sports\FIXME{cite GRIFFIN et al). Once the forces exceed the resistance offered by ACL, the ligament buckles to release the stress. This natural body mechanism of releasing stress by buckling causes the knee joint to achieve angles that rupture the ACL. Moreover, the decelerations can increase the risk of injury as it can generate higher forces and cause strain in ACL \FIXME{cite GRIFFIN et al).
