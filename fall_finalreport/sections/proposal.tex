This project focuses on the research and development of eKwip, an electronic knee wrap for injury prediction and prevention, for both healthy athletes as well as patients recovered from an ACL injury. Unlike traditional mechanical knee braces, eKwip is unobtrusive and flexible. It is able to adapt to and learn the pattern of movements of its wearer, closely monitor the performance of his or her knee, predict when an injury is imminent and reduce the impact of the injury. Through eKwip, the wearer or physical therapist is able to monitor the performance of the knee and assess the risk of injury in the future through a simple user interface. This can allow both healthy athletes to reduce the risk of injury, as well as allow injured patients to monitor their risk of reinjury over time. eKwip also provides an easy way for physical therapist to observe their patients and judge whether they are fit to return to sports.
